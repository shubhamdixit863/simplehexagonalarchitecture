`This repository is structured using the Hexagonal Architecture pattern, which is a software design approach for building flexible and maintainable applications. The structure consists of four main folders:`

# cmd/web/handlers
The handlers folder contains the implementation of the application's use cases, or the actions that the user can perform through the application's interface. These are the objects that receive incoming requests and delegate the processing to the appropriate parts of the system.

main.go
The main.go file is the entry point of the application and is responsible for starting the application and configuring its components.

# cmd/web/models
The models folder contains the implementation of the data structures used in the application. These structures define the structure of the data that will be stored and processed by the system.

# cmd/web/repository
The repository folder contains the implementation of the persistence layer, which is responsible for storing and retrieving data from a permanent storage mechanism such as a database. This layer serves as the connection between the application's core logic and the storage mechanism.

By using this Hexagonal Architecture pattern, the application's components are loosely coupled and can be easily maintained and tested in isolation, making the application more flexible and scalable.
